"""
Optional project capability: Memory & Persistent Conversation State.

Implement this module only if this capability is relevant to your application's
user problem. Remove the file if the capability is not used.

Conceptual Overview:
-------------------
Memory enables an application to retain conversational context across multiple user interactions
or persist state between user sessions.

Key concepts when implementing memory:
1. Short-term Memory (Chat History): Maintaining an ordered list of user and assistant
   messages within the current session and appending them to model requests.
2. Context Window Management: Truncating, summarizing, or pruning history when it exceeds
   the model's maximum context length.
3. Long-term / Persistent Memory: Storing user preferences, session history, or key facts
   in local files or persistent state stores.

Note:
-----
Keep memory implementations simple and relevant to the user's workflow needs.
